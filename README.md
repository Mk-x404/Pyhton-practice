# Python Practice â€“ AI and Data Science Journey

This repository contains Python notebooks and scripts Iâ€™ve created while learning Python as part of my AI and Data Science course. It includes practice programs that demonstrate core concepts and logical thinking.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

### 1. Student report.ipynb
A basic program to input student names and marks, calculate total and percentage, and display results. Useful for understanding variables, input/output, and calculations.

### 2. Shapes through loops.ipynb
Generates pattern shapes (like stars and triangles) using nested `for` loops. Great for learning loop logic and flow control.

### 3. Excercise loops.ipynb
A set of small programs that focus on practicing `for` and `while` loops with various logic-based examples.

### 4. Even odd checker.py
This script checks whether a number is even or odd in a loop. It continues running until the user chooses to stop.

**Concepts Used:**
- Infinite `while` loop  
- Modulo operation for even/odd  
- User input and flow control using `break` and `continue`

### 5. Calculator with functions.py
A simple calculator using functions and parameters to perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Concepts Used:**
- Function definition  
- Conditional statements  
- Input/output handling

### 6. Showroom console program.py
Simulates a basic showroom using lists and `if-else` statements. The user can select items, and the program calculates the total cost based on selected options.

**Concepts Used:**
- Lists  
- Menu selection using conditions  
- Basic input/output

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repository helps me:
- Practice Python from the ground up
- Apply programming logic through real examples
- Track my learning progress over time
- Prepare a portfolio for future projects in AI and Data Science

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

I will continue updating this repo with more Python notebooks and scripts as I explore:
- Functions, Lists, Dictionaries
- File Handling
- NumPy, pandas
- Beginner AI and data projects
